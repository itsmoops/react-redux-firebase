# react-redux-firebase
A React, Redux and Firebase boilerplate with user Authentication 99% set up.

## Setup
#### Create a Database
Log in to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create a new project if you don't already have one.

#### Enable Authentication
In the left nav of your database console, click "Authentication", and then click the "Set Up Sign-In Method" button. This project requires that Email/Password is enabled. Enable any other auth providers you might want to use.

#### Enable Realtime Database
In the left nav of your database console, click "Database", and then click the "Get Started" button. The default rules require that a user be authenticated to read or write data. Info about security rules can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/quickstart?authuser=0).

#### Enable Database Storage
In the left nav of your database console, click "Storage", and then click the "Get Started" -> "Got It" buttons. This will enable your database to use file storage (can be used for profile pictures, etc.)

#### Add Database Config to Project
In the left nav of your database console, click "Overview", and then click the "Add Firebase to your web app" button. This should launch a modal with your database config options.

You will want to copy the config object and place it in the `./src/firebase-config.js` file under the appropriate environment key.

#### Install Dependencies

````
yarn global add firebase-tools
yarn install
````

`firebase login` and `firebase init` commands will run as a part of the `yarn install` postinstall.

Select the following options during the `firebase init` prompts:
* Which Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this folder?
	* Select Database, Hosting and Storage
* Select a default Firebase project for this directory:
	* Select the project you just created
* What file should be used for Database Rules?
	* Default or named is fine
* What do you want to use as your public directory?
	* dist
* Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?
	* y
* File dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite?
	* N
* What file should be used for Storage Rules?
	* Default or named is fine

Update your personal database settings under `./src/firebase-config.js`

#### Environment Assumptions:
This repository is set up to deploy to 3 different Firebase environments with the following aliases: `dev`, `staging` and `prod`

You can associate additional Firebase databases with your project from the firebase cli tools using `firebase use --add`, which will prompt you to select another project and give it an alias.

You will want to make sure that your generated `.firebaserc` file looks something like this in order for deploys to work:

````
{
  // use your own db names
  "projects": {
	"dev": "boilerplate",
	"staging": "boilerplate-staging",
	"prod": "boilerplate-prod"
  }
}
````

You can now switch databases by using one of the 3 aliases, ex: `firebase use prod`

## Usage
### Develop
Webpack dev server running at <http://localhost:8080>
````
yarn start
````

### Deploy
Assuming you used the database aliases above, you now have simple yarn commands to deploy your app to your three environments.

````
yarn deploy-dev
yarn deploy-staging
yarn deploy-prod
````
